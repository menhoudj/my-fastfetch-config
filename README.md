My Fastfetch Config

This repository provides a custom Fastfetch configuration with random logo rotation for Fish shell. It allows you to have a fresh, unique logo displayed each time you open a terminal, while keeping your Fastfetch setup organized.

Features

Random logo selection from a predefined logos folder.

Avoids repeating logos until all have been displayed.

Fully replaces config.fish to automatically call Fastfetch on terminal startup.

Replaces Fastfetch config.jsonc with a custom configuration.

Easy installation via install.sh
